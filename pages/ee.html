          <h2 class="fade-up"><br>Everybody edits was a live, multiplayer 2D Platform game where players can create worlds for each other to enjoy,
            that I was a staff member of from 2017-2020. My primary role as a staff member was to design and feature levels for users
            to beat, but I also ran events, created graphics, and designed new features for the playerbase to enjoy. <br><br>Unfortunately, the
            game was shut down on New Years Eve of 2020 due to the Adobe Flash EOL, but what I've learned as both a community and staff member
            of the game can be seen in my design philosophy of every one of my projects since.<br><br>
            Below are some of the features I was directly involved in the creation of.</h2>
