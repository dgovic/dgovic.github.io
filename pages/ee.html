          <h2><br>Everybody edits was a live, multiplayer 2D Platform game where players can create worlds for each other to enjoy,
            that I was a staff member of from 2017-2020. My primary role as a staff member was to design and feature levels for users
          to beat, but I also ran events, created graphics, and designed new features for the playerbase to enjoy. Unfortunately, the
        game was shut down on New Years Eve of 2020 due to the Adobe Flash EOL, but what I've learned as both a community and staff member
      of the game can be seen in my design philosophy of every one of my projects since.</h2>
